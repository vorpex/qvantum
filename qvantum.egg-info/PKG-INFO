Description: 
        ## 1. Summary
        
        qvantum is a python module, and it's goal is to ensure an easy use library for understanding quantum computing better or designing new quantum algorithms. Working with this module helps you to get more familiar with the basic concepts such as qubit, register or quantum gate, meanwhile the tool has the power for deeper analysis and development.
        
        The module is in beta release phase: tested but it might contain bugs, therefore every constructive note is highly appreciated. Also if you would like to collaborate in the developing process do not hesitate to contact us.
